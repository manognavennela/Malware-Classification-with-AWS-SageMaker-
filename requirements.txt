boto3==1.18.63: I used Boto3, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, to interact with various AWS services such as S3 for storing large datasets or EC2 for running distributed computations.

pandas==1.3.3: Pandas is essential for data manipulation and analysis. I used it to clean and preprocess raw transactional data, perform aggregations, and create insightful visualizations to understand customer behavior better.

numpy==1.21.2: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. I'm leveraging its array data structures and mathematical functions to perform efficient computations, especially when dealing with large datasets.

scikit-learn==0.24.2: Scikit-learn is the go-to library for machine learning tasks. I utilized its various algorithms for customer segmentation, classification of purchasing patterns, and predictive modeling to forecast future sales trends.

requests==2.26.0: Requests is used for making HTTP requests in Python. In this project, additional data is fetched from external APIs, such as demographic information or product reviews, to enrich the analysis.

scipy==1.7.1: SciPy, a companion library to NumPy, provides additional functionality for scientific computing. Used its statistical functions for hypothesis testing, as well as its optimization and integration routines for more advanced analytics tasks.
