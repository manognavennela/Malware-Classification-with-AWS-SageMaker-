# Malware-Classification-with-AWS-SageMaker-
In the fast-paced digital world, where our lives are increasingly reliant on technology, cybersecurity stands as a paramount concern. The rise of malicious executable files (EXE) poses significant risks to computer systems and networks, making their detection and classification imperative for maintaining security. Today, I'm excited to share with you our journey in developing a robust malware detection tool using AWS SageMaker, a powerful machine learning service offered by Amazon Web Services. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest binary classifier, our tool provides a scalable and efficient solution for identifying malicious Portable Executable (PE) files.

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is of paramount importance, with the proliferation of malicious executable files (EXE) posing significant threats to computer systems and networks. In response to this growing concern, our team embarked on a mission to develop an advanced solution that harnesses the power of machine learning and cloud computing. After extensive research and development efforts, we are pleased to introduce our cloud-based malware detection API built on AWS SageMaker.

AWS SageMaker, a leading machine learning service provided by Amazon Web Services, serves as the cornerstone of our project. Leveraging its robust infrastructure and tools, we have created a sophisticated platform for model development and deployment. Our solution relies on the Random Forest binary classifier, a highly effective algorithm renowned for its accuracy in distinguishing between malicious and benign executables. Trained on a meticulously curated dataset of binary feature vectors, our model demonstrates exceptional proficiency in identifying potential threats.


**Setup** To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

**Install Dependencies:** 
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Deploy Model on SageMaker** 
Follow the instructions in Building a Static Malware Detector using RFC.ipynb to deploy the trained model on AWS SageMaker.

**Model Usage** Once the model is deployed, you can use the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.

**Performance Evaluation:** To assess the model's effectiveness, Malware exe and Benign exe files were given. The classification results are summarized below:

**Malware File:** • When the Malware exe file is provided, it detects the malware file and shows up the message.

**Benign File:** • When the Benign exe file is provided, it detects the Benign file and shows up the message.

My project achieves its objectives successfully, demonstrating:
- **Trained Malware Detection Model:** A Random Forest classifier capable of accurately distinguishing between malicious and benign PE files.
- **Deployed Cloud API:** The model is deployed on AWS SageMaker, offering a scalable and efficient API for real-time malware detection.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** A web-based application is developed, providing an intuitive platform for users to upload and analyze EXE files seamlessly.


**Contribution Guidelines** We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve our malware detection system further. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, adding new features, or refining the user interface, your contributions are invaluable in fortifying our defenses against cyber threats.
