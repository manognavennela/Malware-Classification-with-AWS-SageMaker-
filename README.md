# Malware-Classification-with-AWS-SageMaker-
This repository contains the implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. Additionally, a Python client is provided to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the deployed endpoint.

**Introduction** Malware poses a significant threat to the security and integrity of computer systems, making robust detection mechanisms imperative. This project is dedicated to addressing this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a sophisticated model for malware detection. Trained on the extensive EMBER 2018 dataset, the model excels in accurately classifying executable files as either benign or malicious, thereby fortifying defenses against cyber threats. By deploying the model as an API endpoint on AWS SageMaker, this project ensures scalability and reliability in malware classification. This cloud-based solution not only streamlines the detection process but also enhances the adaptability of the system to evolving threats.

**Setup** To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:** [https://github.com/manognavennela/Malware-Detection-API.git](https://github.com/manognavennela/Malware-Classification-with-AWS-SageMaker-.git)
**Presentation link** - https://youtu.be/J2qtttDey-A
**Install Dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt
**Deploy Model on SageMaker** Follow the instructions in Building a Static Malware Detector using RFC.ipynb to deploy the trained model on AWS SageMaker.

**Model Usage** Once the model is deployed, you can use the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.

**Performance Evaluation:** To assess the model's effectiveness, Malware exe and Benign exe files were given. The classification results are summarized below:

**Malware File:** • When the Malware exe file is provided, it detects the malware file and shows up the message.

**Benign File:** • When the Benign exe file is provided, it detects the Benign file and shows up the message.

Contribution Guidelines We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve our malware detection system further. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, adding new features, or refining the user interface, your contributions are invaluable in fortifying our defenses against cyber threats.
