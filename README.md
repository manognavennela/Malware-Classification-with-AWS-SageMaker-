# Malware-Classification-with-AWS-SageMaker-
This repository contains the implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. Additionally, a Python client is provided to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the deployed endpoint.

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is of paramount importance, with the proliferation of malicious executable files (EXE) posing significant threats to computer systems and networks. In response to this growing concern, our team embarked on a mission to develop an advanced solution that harnesses the power of machine learning and cloud computing. After extensive research and development efforts, we are pleased to introduce our cloud-based malware detection API built on AWS SageMaker.

AWS SageMaker, a leading machine learning service provided by Amazon Web Services, serves as the cornerstone of our project. Leveraging its robust infrastructure and tools, we have created a sophisticated platform for model development and deployment. Our solution relies on the Random Forest binary classifier, a highly effective algorithm renowned for its accuracy in distinguishing between malicious and benign executables. Trained on a meticulously curated dataset of binary feature vectors, our model demonstrates exceptional proficiency in identifying potential threats.


**Setup** To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

**Install Dependencies:** 
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Deploy Model on SageMaker** 
Follow the instructions in Building a Static Malware Detector using RFC.ipynb to deploy the trained model on AWS SageMaker.

**Model Usage** Once the model is deployed, you can use the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.

**Performance Evaluation:** To assess the model's effectiveness, Malware exe and Benign exe files were given. The classification results are summarized below:

**Malware File:** • When the Malware exe file is provided, it detects the malware file and shows up the message.

**Benign File:** • When the Benign exe file is provided, it detects the Benign file and shows up the message.

**Contribution Guidelines** We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve our malware detection system further. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, adding new features, or refining the user interface, your contributions are invaluable in fortifying our defenses against cyber threats.
